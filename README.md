A Secure Service Proxy for Robot Control and Monitor

we want to securely control our robot by remote clients through Internet. Therefore, we should develop a proxy server to control the commands sent from the clients, to send robots’ statuses back to authenticated clients, and to keep the robot running fast and secure. The project scope is to build a proxy server, client end software, and SSH proxy. The scope does not include the quality of the robot like the performance of robots’ reaction.
